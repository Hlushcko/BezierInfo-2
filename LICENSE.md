The following license terms apply to this repository and its derivative website and repositories:

- you may use any illustrative code found in the `docs/chapters` directories without crediting.
- you may use any illustrative graphics found in the `docs/images` directories without crediting.
- you may quote up to two paragraphs from the `docs/chapters` markdown documents without crediting.
- you may quote an entire section from any chapter, as long as it's credited and links back to the chapter that section is in on the official website.

If you wish to quote more than one section of a chapter (such as an entire chapter, or more than one chapter), you may do so only after requesting, and getting, explicit permission. Permission should be sought by filing an issue in this repository, which will act as permanent record of the granted permissions.

Outside of the above permissions, the following prohibitions and copyrights apply:

- You may not put up a clone of the entire work (meaning that if you fork the project, you may not turn on gh-pages to get it automatically hosted by github itself on your own account domain).
- The code in `docs/js/graphics-element/lib` consists of third party libraries governed by their own licenses.

Any other material not explicitly covered by this license is to be treated as having all rights reserved.
Please file an issue for license clarification questions.
